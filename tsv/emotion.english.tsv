The Good-Morrow		

I wonder, by my troth, what thou and I	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Did, till we loved?	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Were we not weaned till then?	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
But sucked on country pleasures, childishly?	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Or snorted we in the Seven Sleepers? den?	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
?Twas so; but this, all pleasures fancies be.	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
If ever any beauty I did see,	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Which I desired, and got, ?twas but a dream of thee.	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy

And now good-morrow to our waking souls,	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Which watch not one another out of fear;	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
For love, all love of other sights controls,	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
And makes one little room an everywhere.	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Let sea-discoverers to new worlds have gone,	Vitality	Vitality
Let maps to other, worlds on worlds have shown,	Vitality	Vitality
Let us possess one world, each hath one, and is one.	Vitality	Vitality

My face in thine eye, thine in mine appears,	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
And true plain hearts do in the faces rest;	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Where can we find two better hemispheres,	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Without sharp north, without declining west?	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Whatever dies, was not mixed equally;	Beauty / Joy --- Awe / Sublime	Vitality
If our two loves be one, or, thou and I	Beauty / Joy --- Awe / Sublime	Vitality
Love so alike, that none do slacken, none can die.	Beauty / Joy --- Awe / Sublime	Vitality

Be fair or foul or rain or shine	Beauty / Joy --- Awe / Sublime	Vitality
The joys I have possessed, in spite of fate, are mine.	Beauty / Joy --- Awe / Sublime	Vitality
Not Heaven itself upon the past has power,	Beauty / Joy --- Awe / Sublime	Vitality

STANZAS WRITTEN IN DEJECTION , NEAR NAPLES .		

The sun is warm , the sky is clear ,	Beauty / Joy --- Vitality	Beauty / Joy --- Vitality
The waves are dancing fast and bright ,	Beauty / Joy --- Vitality	Beauty / Joy --- Vitality
Blue isles and snowy mountains wear	Beauty / Joy --- Vitality	Beauty / Joy --- Vitality
The purple noon "s transparent might ,	Beauty / Joy --- Vitality	Beauty / Joy --- Vitality
The breath of the moist earth is light ,	Beauty / Joy --- Vitality	Beauty / Joy --- Vitality
Around its unexpanded buds ;	Beauty / Joy --- Vitality	Beauty / Joy --- Vitality
Like many a voice of one delight ,	Beauty / Joy --- Vitality	Beauty / Joy --- Vitality

With green and purple seaweeds strown ;	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
I see the waves upon the shore ,	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Like light dissolved in star-showers , thrown :	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
I sit upon the sands alone ,?	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
The lightning of the noontide ocean	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy

Arises from its measured motion ,	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
How sweet !	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
did any heart now share in my emotion .	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy

Alas !	Sadness	Sadness
I have nor hope nor health ,	Sadness	Sadness
Nor peace within nor calm around ,	Sadness	Sadness
Nor that content surpassing wealth	Sadness	Sadness
The sage in meditation found ,	Sadness	Sadness
And walked with inward glory crowned ?	Sadness	Sadness
Nor fame , nor power , nor love , nor leisure .	Sadness	Sadness
Others I see whom these surround ?	Sadness --- Annoyance	Sadness
Smiling they live , and call life pleasure ;?	Sadness --- Annoyance	Sadness
To me that cup has been dealt in another measure .	Sadness --- Annoyance	Sadness

Yet now despair itself is mild ,	Sadness	Sadness
Even as the winds and waters are ;	Sadness	Sadness
I could lie down like a tired child ,	Sadness	Sadness
And weep away the life of care	Sadness	Sadness
Which I have borne and yet must bear ,	Sadness	Sadness
Till death like sleep might steal on me ,	Sadness	Sadness
And I might feel in the warm air	Sadness	Sadness
My cheek grow cold , and hear the sea	Sadness	Sadness
Breathe o"er my dying brain its last monotony .	Sadness	Sadness

Some might lament that I were cold ,	Sadness	Sadness
As I , when this sweet day is gone ,	Sadness	Sadness
Which my lost heart , too soon grown old ,	Sadness	Sadness
Insults with this untimely moan ;	Sadness	Sadness
They might lament ? for I am one	Sadness	Sadness
Whom men love not ,? and yet regret ,	Sadness	Sadness
Unlike this day , which , when the sun	Sadness	Sadness
Shall on its stainless glory set ,	Sadness	Sadness
Will linger , though enjoyed , like joy in memory yet .	Sadness	Sadness

O well for the fisherman "s boy ,	Vitality	Vitality
That he shouts with his sister at play !	Vitality	Vitality
O well for the sailor lad ,	Vitality	Vitality
That he sings in his boat on the bay !	Vitality	Vitality

And the stately ships go on	Vitality	Beauty / Joy

The Way through the Woods		

They shut the road through the woods	Sadness	Suspense
Seventy years ago.	Sadness	Suspense
Weather and rain have undone it again,	Sadness --- Nostalgia	Nostalgia --- Sadness
And now you would never know	Sadness --- Nostalgia	Nostalgia --- Sadness
There was once a road through the woods	Sadness --- Nostalgia	Nostalgia --- Sadness
Before they planted the trees.	Sadness --- Nostalgia	Nostalgia --- Sadness
It is underneath the coppice and heath,	Beauty / Joy	Sadness
And the thin anemones.	Beauty / Joy	Sadness
Only the keeper sees	Beauty / Joy --- Nostalgia	Sadness --- Nostalgia
That, where the ring-dove broods,	Beauty / Joy --- Nostalgia	Sadness --- Nostalgia
And the badgers roll at ease,	Beauty / Joy --- Nostalgia	Sadness --- Nostalgia
There was once a road through the woods.	Beauty / Joy --- Nostalgia	Sadness --- Nostalgia

Yet, if you enter the woods	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Of a summer evening late,	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
When the night-air cools on the trout-ringed pools	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Where the otter whistles his mate,	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
(They fear not men in the woods,	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Because they see so few.)	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
You will hear the beat of a horse?s feet,	Beauty / Joy	Nostalgia --- Beauty / Joy
And the swish of a skirt in the dew,	Beauty / Joy	Nostalgia --- Beauty / Joy
Steadily cantering through	Beauty / Joy	Nostalgia --- Beauty / Joy
The misty solitudes,	Beauty / Joy	Nostalgia --- Beauty / Joy
As though they perfectly knew	Sadness --- Nostalgia	Nostalgia --- Sadness
The old lost road through the woods.	Sadness --- Nostalgia	Nostalgia --- Sadness
But there is no road through the woods.	Sadness --- Nostalgia	Nostalgia --- Sadness


THE SICK ROSE		

O rose , thou art sick !	Sadness --- Uneasiness	Uneasiness
The invisible worm ,	Sadness --- Uneasiness	Uneasiness
That flies in the night ,	Sadness --- Uneasiness	Uneasiness
In the howling storm ,	Sadness --- Uneasiness	Uneasiness

Has found out thy bed	Sadness --- Uneasiness	Uneasiness
Of crimson joy ,	Sadness --- Uneasiness	Uneasiness
And his dark secret love	Sadness --- Uneasiness	Uneasiness
Does thy life destroy .	Sadness --- Uneasiness	Uneasiness


A POISON TREE		

I was angry with my friend :	Annoyance	Annoyance
I told my wrath , my wrath did end .	Annoyance	Annoyance
I was angry with my foe :	Annoyance	Annoyance
I told it not , my wrath did grow .	Annoyance	Annoyance

And I watered it in fears	Annoyance	Annoyance
Night and morning with my tears ,	Annoyance	Annoyance
And I sunned it with smiles	Annoyance	Annoyance
And with soft deceitful wiles .	Annoyance	Annoyance


Composed Upon Westminster Bridge, September 3, 1802		

Earth has not anything to show more fair:	Beauty / Joy --- Awe / Sublime	Beauty / Joy --- Awe / Sublime
Dull would he be of soul who could pass by	Beauty / Joy --- Awe / Sublime	Beauty / Joy --- Awe / Sublime
A sight so touching in its majesty:	Beauty / Joy --- Awe / Sublime	Beauty / Joy --- Awe / Sublime
This City now doth, like a garment, wear	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
The beauty of the morning: silent, bare,	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Ships, towers, domes, theatres, and temples lie	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Open unto the fields, and to the sky;	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
All bright and glittering in the smokeless air.	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Never did sun more beautifully steep	Beauty / Joy --- Awe / Sublime	Beauty / Joy --- Awe / Sublime
In his first splendour, valley, rock, or hill;	Beauty / Joy --- Awe / Sublime	Beauty / Joy --- Awe / Sublime
Ne?er saw I, never felt, a calm so deep!	Beauty / Joy --- Awe / Sublime	Beauty / Joy --- Awe / Sublime
The river glideth at his own sweet will:	Beauty / Joy --- Awe / Sublime	Beauty / Joy --- Awe / Sublime
Dear God!	Beauty / Joy --- Awe / Sublime	Beauty / Joy --- Awe / Sublime
the very houses seem asleep;	Beauty / Joy --- Awe / Sublime	Beauty / Joy --- Awe / Sublime
And all that mighty heart is lying still!	Beauty / Joy --- Awe / Sublime	Beauty / Joy --- Awe / Sublime


The Rainbow		

My heart leaps up when I behold	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
A rainbow in the sky:	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
So was it when my life began;	Beauty / Joy --- Nostalgia	Beauty / Joy --- Nostalgia
So is it now I am a man;	Beauty / Joy --- Nostalgia	Beauty / Joy --- Nostalgia
So be it when I shall grow old,	Beauty / Joy	Vitality
Or let me die!	Beauty / Joy	Vitality
The Child is father of the Man;	Vitality --- Beauty / Joy	Vitality --- Beauty / Joy
And I could wish my days to be	Vitality --- Beauty / Joy	Vitality --- Beauty / Joy
Bound each to each by natural piety.	Vitality --- Beauty / Joy	Vitality --- Beauty / Joy


Grief		

I tell you, hopeless grief is passionless;	Sadness	Sadness
That only men incredulous of despair,	Sadness	Sadness
Half-taught in anguish, through the midnight air	Sadness	Sadness
Beat upward to God?s throne in loud access	Sadness	Sadness
Of shrieking and reproach.	Sadness	Sadness
Full desertness,	Sadness	Sadness
In souls as countries, lieth silent-bare	Sadness	Sadness
Under the blanching, vertical eye-glare	Sadness	Sadness
Of the absolute heavens.	Sadness	Sadness
Deep-hearted man, express	Sadness	Sadness
Grief for thy dead in silence like to death?	Sadness	Sadness
Most like a monumental statue set	Sadness	Sadness
In everlasting watch and moveless woe	Sadness	Sadness
Till itself crumble to the dust beneath.	Sadness	Sadness
Touch it; the marble eyelids are not wet:	Sadness	Sadness
If it could weep, it could arise and go.	Sadness	Sadness


Sonnet XXIV		

Let the world "s sharpness , like a clasping knife ,	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Shut in upon itself and do no harm	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
In this close hand of Love , now soft and warm ,	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
And let us hear no sound of human strife	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
After the click of the shutting .	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Life to life ?	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
I lean upon thee , Dear , without alarm ,	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
And feel as safe as guarded by a charm	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Against the stab of worldlings , who if rife	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Are weak to injure .	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Very-whitely still	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
The lilies of our lives may reassure	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Their blossoms from their roots , accessible	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Alone to heavenly dews that drop not fewer	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Growing straight , out of man "s reach , on the hill .	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
God only , who made us rich , can make us poor .	Awe / Sublime	Beauty / Joy --- Awe / Sublime


AH, how sweet it is to love!		

AH, how sweet it is to love!	Vitality	Beauty / Joy --- Vitality
Ah, how gay is young Desire!	Vitality	Beauty / Joy --- Vitality

When we first approach Love"s fire!	Vitality	Beauty / Joy --- Vitality
Pains of love be sweeter far	Vitality	Beauty / Joy --- Vitality
Than all other pleasures are.	Vitality	Beauty / Joy --- Vitality

Sighs which are from lovers blown	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Do but gently heave the heart:	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Ev"n the tears they shed alone	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Cure, like trickling balm, their smart:	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Lovers, when they lose their breath,	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Bleed away in easy death.	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy

Love and Time with reverence use,	Beauty / Joy --- Sadness	Beauty / Joy
Treat them like a parting friend;	Beauty / Joy --- Sadness	Beauty / Joy
Nor the golden gifts refuse	Beauty / Joy --- Sadness	Beauty / Joy
Which in youth sincere they send:	Beauty / Joy --- Sadness	Beauty / Joy
For each year their price is more,	Beauty / Joy --- Sadness	Beauty / Joy
And they less simple than before.	Beauty / Joy --- Sadness	Beauty / Joy

Love, like spring-tides full and high,	Sadness	Sadness
Swells in every youthful vein;	Sadness	Sadness
But each tide does less supply,	Sadness	Sadness
Till they quite shrink in again:	Sadness	Sadness
If a flow in age appear,	Sadness	Sadness
"Tis but rain, and runs not clear.	Sadness	Sadness

Morning at the Window		

They are rattling breakfast plates in basement kitchens ,	Uneasiness	Uneasiness
And along the trampled edges of the street	Uneasiness	Uneasiness
I am aware of the damp souls of housemaids	Uneasiness	Uneasiness
Sprouting despondently at area gates .	Uneasiness	Uneasiness

The brown waves of fog toss up to me	Uneasiness	Uneasiness
Twisted faces from the bottom of the street ,	Uneasiness	Uneasiness
And tear from a passer-by with muddy skirts	Uneasiness	Uneasiness
An aimless smile that hovers in the air	Sadness --- Uneasiness	Uneasiness
And vanishes along the level of the roofs .	Sadness --- Uneasiness	Uneasiness

Six o"clock .	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
The burnt-out ends of smoky days .	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
And now a gusty shower wraps	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
The grimy scraps	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
Of withered leaves about your feet	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
And newspapers from vacant lots ;	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
The showers beat	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
On broken blinds and chimney-pots ,	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
And at the corner of the street	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
A lonely cab-horse steams and stamps .	Sadness --- Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy
And then the lighting of the lamps .	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy

The morning comes to consciousness	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy --- Vitality
Of faint stale smells of beer	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy --- Vitality
From the sawdust-trampled street	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy --- Vitality
With all its muddy feet that press	Beauty / Joy	Beauty / Joy --- Vitality

The thousand sordid images	Uneasiness	Uneasiness --- Sadness

Sitting along the bed "s edge , where	Sadness --- Uneasiness	Sadness --- Uneasiness
You curled the papers from your hair ,	Sadness --- Uneasiness	Sadness --- Uneasiness

In the palms of both soiled hands .	Uneasiness	Sadness --- Uneasiness

His soul stretched tight across the skies	Vitality	Vitality

And evening newspapers , and eyes	Vitality	Vitality
Assured of certain certainties ,	Vitality	Vitality
The conscience of a blackened street	Vitality	Vitality
Impatient to assume the world .	Vitality	Vitality
I am moved by fancies that are curled	Vitality	Vitality
Around these images , and cling :	Vitality	Vitality
The notion of some infinitely gentle	Awe / Sublime	Vitality --- Awe / Sublime

The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere	Uneasiness	Uneasiness
The ceremony of innocence is drowned;	Uneasiness	Uneasiness
The best lack all conviction, while the worst	Uneasiness	Uneasiness
Are full of passionate intensity.	Uneasiness	Uneasiness

Surely some revelation is at hand;	Suspense	Suspense
Surely the Second Coming is at hand.	Suspense	Suspense
The Second Coming!	Suspense	Suspense --- Uneasiness
Hardly are those words out	Suspense	Suspense --- Uneasiness
When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi	Suspense	Suspense --- Uneasiness
Troubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert	Suspense --- Uneasiness	Suspense --- Uneasiness
A shape with lion body and the head of a man,	Suspense --- Uneasiness	Suspense --- Uneasiness
A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,	Suspense --- Uneasiness	Suspense --- Uneasiness
Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it	Suspense --- Uneasiness	Suspense --- Uneasiness
Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds.	Suspense --- Uneasiness	Suspense --- Uneasiness
The darkness drops again; but now I know	Suspense --- Uneasiness	Uneasiness
That twenty centuries of stony sleep	Suspense --- Uneasiness	Uneasiness
Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,	Suspense --- Uneasiness	Uneasiness
And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,	Suspense --- Uneasiness	Uneasiness
Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?	Suspense --- Uneasiness	Uneasiness

Their God deny "d , all for the Idol Gold .	Annoyance --- Sadness	Sadness --- Uneasiness

Unhappy Wretch , who first found out the Oar ,	Annoyance	Uneasiness --- Annoyance
What kind of Vengeance rests for thee in store ?	Annoyance	Uneasiness --- Annoyance
If Nebats Son , that Israel led astray ,	Annoyance	Uneasiness --- Annoyance
Meet a severe Reward at the last Day ?	Annoyance	Uneasiness --- Annoyance
Some strange unheard-of Judgement thou wilt find ,	Annoyance	Uneasiness --- Annoyance
Who thus hast caus "d to Sin all Humane Kind .	Annoyance	Uneasiness --- Annoyance

Outdid the sparkling waves in glee :?	Beauty / Joy --- Vitality	Beauty / Joy
A Poet could not but be gay	Beauty / Joy --- Vitality	Beauty / Joy
In such a laughing company :	Beauty / Joy --- Vitality	Beauty / Joy

What wealth the shew to me had brought :	Beauty / Joy --- Suspense	Beauty / Joy --- Suspense

For oft when on my couch I lie	Nostalgia --- Beauty / Joy	Nostalgia --- Beauty / Joy
In vacant or in pensive mood ,	Nostalgia --- Beauty / Joy	Nostalgia --- Beauty / Joy
